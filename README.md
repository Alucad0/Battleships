### Descrption of the project

This project is going to be an online game of battleships using socket. The programm will start by either making the user logging in or making an account. Thereafter the UI will open and the user will be able to choice to play, view highscore, log out or exit the game. The game of battleships will take place online against other people with two boards, one for placing and rotating ones own ships and one for shooting and sinking the opponents ship. These boards will update after each shot. After the game is finnished the statistics of teh game will be saved to socket.

### Code conventions

**File organisation:** The code is divided into different files, by order of functions, for easier interaction and to facilitate contributions.

**Naming convention:** All the files use **snake_case** for variable names.

**Comments:** One-line comments are written above the code line to explain the code and its purpose. The same principle applies to block comments.
