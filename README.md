### Code conventions

**File organisation:** The code is divided into different files, by order of functions, for easier interaction and to facilitate contributions.

**Naming convention:** All the files use **snake_case** for variable names.

**Comments:** One-line comments are written above the code line to explain the code and its purpose. The same principle applies to block comments.
