### Descrption of the project

This project is going to be a two player OOP (Object-oriented programming) game of battleships using an API.
The program will start by displaying the UI (User intereface) with a plethora of options. The user will choose between playing, viewing highscores or see instructions by pressing keys that correlate to each option. When the user chooses to play it will ask for a username, then the a user will place the ships followed by the other guessing thier location. 

### Requirements

- Python.
- pygame module.
- requests module.

### Installation

Battleships is was made with __Python 3.7+__. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The two packages (pygame & requests) can be install your IDE (Intergrated Developer Enviroment). 
Note that each IDE has a different way to install packages. 
Otherwise you can use the command prompt and change the directory to the scripts folder of the location of where Python is installed, then type `pip install pygame` and `pip install requests`.

### Code conventions

__File organisation:__ The code is divided into different files, by order of functions, for easier interaction and to facilitate contributions.

**Naming convention:** All the files use **snake_case** for variable names.

**Comments:** One-line comments are written above the code line to explain the code and its purpose. The same principle applies to block comments.
